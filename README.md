# Chocolate Sales Sql Data Pipeline
End-to-end SQL data pipeline for analyzing global chocolate sales, covering raw ingestion, data cleaning, transformation, and analytics-ready datasets using PostgreSQL.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end SQL-based data engineering pipeline using PostgreSQL.
The pipeline processes raw transactional chocolate sales data and transforms it into analytics-ready datasets for business insights.

The focus of this project is on:
a. Data modeling
b. SQL-based data transformation
c. Schema separation (raw, staging, analytics)
d. Reproducible data pipelines

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains global chocolate sales transactions, including:
a.Sales person
b.Country
c.Product
d.Transaction date
e.Sales amount
f.Boxes shipped

The raw data includes unclean formats such as currency symbols, text-based dates, and string-based numeric fields, making it suitable for real-world data cleaning scenarios.
